# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)

The versions coincide with releases on Github.

## [0.0.x](https://github.com/vsoch/django-nginx-upload/tree/master) (0.0.x)
 - updating nginx version  (0.0.11)
 - initial release (first verison released)  (0.0.10)
